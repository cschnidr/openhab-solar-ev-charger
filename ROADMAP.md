# Development Roadmap

## Version 1.1 - Enhanced Control ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Minimal excess charging mode (600W threshold)
- ✅ Global phase switching control
- ✅ Extended range charging (600W-∞ when both modes enabled)
- ✅ Dynamic threshold calculation
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing functionality

## Version 1.2 - Future Enhancements
- [ ] **Weather-based charging optimization** - Automated excess charging configuration based on weather forecast
- [ ] **SOC integration** - Dynamic charging decisions based on actual State of Charge of the car
- [ ] **Dynamic pricing support** - Charging optimization based on electricity pricing (when available)

## Known Issues / Technical Debt
- [ ] **Auto-restart charging** - When car is connected after power becomes available or charger was stopped manually, excess charging does not automatically start again
- [ ] Refactor configuration to external files
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Implement automated testing
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
